        "3) Most of the times when querying for the information outside of the document provided, then model responded with error that the query does not lies within the provided document. This was expected behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) When experimenting with GPT-3 model, found that it is also using its own knowledge apart from the document provided to it. For instance- In the given document, added one more name in the founders of Google. Then on querying the model, the expectation was that it should return the modified founders as the answer but GPT-3 still provided the actual founders as the answer. This was not expected behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) Another instance of GPT-3 using its own knowledge outside of the document provided. Provided the document which does not have the information about the founder of Apple. The only thing that the document has about Apple is that it is one of the 5 biggest companies in the world. But, model returned the correct response about the founder of Apple. This should not be the case. Observed few more instances like this.\n",
        "\n",
