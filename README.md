# Chatbot-MentalHealth
Built a chatbot to answer the mental health related queries.

1) In Phase_4_Advanced_Modelling_and_Error_Analysis.ipynb, there is a need for the OpenAi API key. Get that key and use it in this notebook.
2) In Phase_5_Deployment_and_Productionization_On_Colab_With_NGROK.ipynb, there are 2 variables defined in the first cell- a) OpenAiAPIKey  b) url.
   a) OpenAiAPIKey = This is needed to access the OpenAi API.
   b) url= This is the location at which Chatbot.html is saved. In the Chatbot-MentalHealth github repo, there is Chatbot.html file. Save this file in the google drive and copy the
   location of that file from google drive and paste it as the url value.   
   
3) To deploy the model, just use the Phase_5_Deployment_and_Productionization_On_Colab_With_NGROK.ipynb.
